            <h4>Archery With Disabilities</h4>
            <p>The club supports archers with all abilities, including members competing at national and international para-archery events and the Invictus Games. Club facilities include indoor shooting facilities, paved disabled parking bays, an accessible toilet, and cement paths between buildings. The grassed outdoor fields are also used by para-archers. Experienced instructors and coaches can take you from novice through to international competitor and our members provide a friendly, supportive environment. You will need to arrange your own carer if required. Please contact us to discuss your requirements.</p>
    
            <p>As a sport, archery can cater for a range of disabilities and visual impairments. Therefore the club wholeheartedly welcomes and encourages people with a disability or visual impairment to join. All newcomers to BTAC must do our Archery Course before being accepted as a club member. Courses are usually held on our outdoor field from 7.45 – 11.30am on the first Saturday of each month, all equipment inclusive. In the event of inclement weather, courses go ahead in the onsite indoor facility. An induction session is held from 8:00am – 11:30am on the Saturday following for course attendees who would like to join the club.</p>
    
            <p>All beginners, including those with a disability or vision impairment, undergo the same instruction process on the same shooting line. If you require an assistant for your participation, your assistant must do the Archery Course with you. This is for your safety and also so that the assistant can receive instruction on how to become an archery assistant.</p>
    
            <p>The club requires advance warning about beginners who have a disability or visual impairment. This will allow the club if necessary to allocate extra coaching or one-on-one coaching. Please be aware that as BTAC is run solely by volunteers and volunteer coaches who give freely of their time, our personnel resources are finite. This necessarily limits the number of disabled and visually impaired archers that we can cater for at any one Archery Course.</p>
    
            <p>Archers who require an assistant and who decide to join the club as members must organise and attend with their own assistant at all times. The club cannot undertake to provide assistants. Assistants are required to join the club as Associate Members (non-shooting members) and can attend the Archery Course free of charge. This ensures that the club meets its insurance obligations and safety protocols are followed.</p>
    
            <p>Please see the Archery Courses section for further details and to register for the next course.</p>

            <p>Participants must wear fully enclosed shoes, tie long hair back and remove ear/nose/lip rings etc.</p>
            <p>The club is very welcoming of people who use wheelchairs or have a disability, however please contact us before booking in as we may wish to arrange a special session with coaches with relevant experience.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that there is a no refund policy for cancellation or no shows.</p>
            <p>Should you wish to discuss any aspect of the session please email bendigoarcheryclub@gmail.com</p>
